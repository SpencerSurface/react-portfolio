# React Portfolio

## Description

This project is a website that serves as a professional portfolio of my web development projects. It provides me with a convenient place from where I can showcase my developer skills. The site was written using React, using Vite for the setup of the app. It is a single-page app, with routing between pages handled on the client side by react-router.

In completing this project, I learned to appreciate how powerful a tool React is. Writing a similar website without React would take a lot longer, especially considering all the code React components allowed me to reuse.

## Installation

No installation required. To run a local instance of the web page, clone the project repository from GitHub, navigate into the top level of the project's directory, and run `npm i`, optionally `npm run build`, and finally `npm start`.

## Usage

Navigate in your browser to the deployed site at https://main--preeminent-cannoli-6b1abd.netlify.app/. Make sure you have JavaScript turned on! Click on the tabs in the navbar to explore the site.

For reference, here is a screenshot of the functioning site: ![Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

## Credits

All code written for this site was written by myself unless otherwise noted. Vite was used to generate the initial structure of the app.
